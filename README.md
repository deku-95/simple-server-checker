# Simple Server Checker
Simple script created with Python to check if the server is online.  
If is offline, it will send an email. (By default Gmail)
Also it creates a log file with the timezone you prefer (editable on the file).

# Usage
You don't need to install anything, just edit some variables and run it.
```
python main.py
```
